# Zootopia with API 🌐🦓🐘
Explore the world of Zootopia dynamically with this project that leverages an API to fetch real-time data about your favorite animals.

Project Overview
Fetching Data from the Zootopia API 🚀
In this project, I've integrated the Zootopia API to dynamically retrieve information about animals. The API, powered by the amazing API Ninjas, provides details about animals based on their names.

How It Works
API Integration: The project uses the Zootopia API to fetch data about animals. The API key ensures secure access.
Dynamic Data Retrieval: The fetch_data function takes an animal's name, queries the API, and returns real-time data in JSON format.

Thanks for stopping by! Happy coding 🐍🚀
